            <p>
              Year 3 Student within "Politehnica" University of Timi»ôoara, I'm currently looking
              to enhance my future Computer Science career by learning new technologies, and develop 
              new skills. I'm driven by my motivation to fulfill goals and dreams, personal or professional.

            <p>
              There isn't a real focused knowledge I have. Personally, I can say I aquired knowledge from
              multiple mentors or courses. For an instance, I've finished "We Speak Code" in the summer of 2017,
              which gave me an abudance of HTML/CSS knowledge and skills, and also built a foundation and welcomed
              me into the Web Programming world. In 2018, I've worked on a website called "20th Century Music", 
              translated in Romanian. If you'd like to take a glance at it, here is the<a href=""> GitHub</a> link.

            <p>
              Anytime I want to escape from the real world, I like to game and listen to music. I know for some
              folks this hobby might not be interesting at all, but I love games, and I am very competitive at them
              too. For the most part, I am playing Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege, but often I'm also playing
              Rocket League too. When I have time, I also like to edit videos and make nature pictures. Here is my
