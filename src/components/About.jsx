              There isn't a real focused knowledge I have. Personally, I can say I aquired knowledge from
              multiple mentors or courses. For an instance, I've finished "We Speak Code" in the summer of 2017,
              which gave me an abudance of HTML/CSS knowledge and skills, and also built a foundation and welcomed
              me into the Web Programming world. In 2018, I've worked on a website called "20th Century Music", 
              translated in Romanian. If you'd like to take a glance at it, here is the<a href="https://github.com/Doominsky/Music_Site_HTML-CSS"> GitHub</a> link.

              Anytime I want to escape from the real world, I like to game and listen to music. I know for some
              folks this hobby might not be interesting at all, but I love games, and I am very competitive at them
              too. For the most part, I am playing Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege, but often I'm also playing
              Rocket League too. I also like to edit videos and make nature pictures. Here is my
