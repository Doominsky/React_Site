                I find myself as a very respectful person, who takes tasks seriously. I believe I will
                cope well with the daily routine of a work environment. Whether I am a superior or
                just a regular employee, I will always remain humble for the task at hand. Respecting each other
                regardless of hierarchy is something I appreciate.

              <p class="text-white">
                I found leadership is a trait I developed over time. It's a stressful role to have, but when
                your efforts get positive results, it's definitely the most satisfying. My relevant experience
                is in eSports. I am currently managing and owning a non-profit organization named
                Digital Threat, focused primarily on Rainbow Six Siege.

              <p class="text-white">
                Teamwork is an aspect I focus on when in a professional environment. Getting along well with
                your work mates, as well as getting outstanding results in a project, together, is an aspect
                which definitely can be seen in myself as a person. I enjoy being in a team, and that will never
                change.

                I believe no matter how difficult a task is, no matter how many obstacles are in your way, 
                always remain positive. If you lose, that will be a reason for you to improve. 
                With sufficient effort, you will be able to achieve any goals you planned to pursue.

              <h1 class="font-weight-light text-white">Conflict Resolution</h1>
              <p class="text-white">
                It's important when there is a peaceful work environment. I am fond of helping in
                resolving conflicts between people, but also I consider myself emotionally intelligent. 
                I find unresolved conflicts destructive to the overall company efficiency, and I do not allow
                it to happen.

              <p class="text-white">
                This trait is one I am happy with. It allows me to socialize easier inside and outside
                of the work environment. Despite at first I feel nervous, rather excited to meet new people,
                within relatively short time, I will be opened up more socially, and making friends
                is a bonus to me.
